# ü¶† COVID-19 Data Analysis Report
This report provides an overview of key COVID-19 trends based on SQL queries executed for data analysis. The insights reveal how the pandemic evolved, the effectiveness of interventions, and the disparities in response across different regions. The data used in this project is available from **January 1, 2020** to **December 4, 2021****.
## üìä Global Trends

### Total Cases, Deaths, and Vaccinations Over Time
- **Purpose:** To analyze the overall trend of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations globally over time.
- **Findings:**
  - A consistent increase in cases and deaths was observed, with peaks aligning with major COVID-19 waves.
  - The introduction of vaccines led to a decline in mortality rates and new cases over time.
  - Significant spikes were observed in early 2020, mid-2021 (Delta wave), and late 2021 (Omicron wave).

### Countries with Highest Cases, Deaths, and Vaccinations
- **Purpose:** To identify the most affected countries in terms of total cases, deaths, and vaccination rates.
- **Findings:**
  - The United States, India, and Brazil recorded the highest number of confirmed cases and deaths.
  - Countries with high vaccination rates, such as China, India, and the U.S., showed a relative decline in severe cases and fatalities over time.

## ‚ö∞Ô∏è Mortality Analysis

### Case Fatality Rate (CFR)
- **Purpose:** To determine the percentage of people who died from the virus among those confirmed to have it.
- **Findings:**
  - During the period the top 3 countries with the highest COVID-19 case fatality rates are Vanuatu (25.00%), Yemen (19.41%), and Mexico (9.25%).

### Deadliest Months
- **Purpose:** to identify the months with the highest number of COVID-19 deaths for each location
- **Findings:**
  - United States had the highest monthly deaths in January 2021, with 97,248 deaths.
  - Brazil recorded its highest monthly deaths in April 2021, with 82,266 deaths.

## üíâ Vaccination Impact

### Effect of Vaccinations on Cases and Deaths
- **Purpose:** To examine how increasing vaccination rates influenced COVID-19 cases and fatalities.
- **Findings:**
  - A direct correlation was observed between vaccination coverage and declining case severity.
  - Countries with higher vaccination rates experienced a notable drop in hospitalization and mortality rates.
  - Booster doses played a critical role in mitigating the spread of new variants.

## üß™ Testing & Spread Analysis

### Testing Numbers Over Time
- **Purpose:** To track testing trends over time and assess their impact on containment efforts.
- **Findings:**
  - Countries that implemented large-scale testing saw earlier detection and better outbreak management.
  - Limited testing in some regions resulted in underreported cases and delayed responses.

## üåç Continental Comparisons

### COVID Impact by Continent
- **Purpose:** To compare the total cases, deaths, and vaccinations across continents.
- **Findings:**
  - Asia has the lowest CFR (1.66%) and a moderate Case Detection Rate (6.96%), with low Vaccination Coverage (0.75%), indicating effective testing but limited vaccination progress.
  - Africa has a high CFR (2.5%) and a relatively high Case Detection Rate (15.75%), but very low Vaccination Coverage (0.088%), suggesting high death rates and limited vaccination efforts.
  - North America has a moderate CFR (2.6%) and decent Case Detection Rate (8.1%), with moderate Vaccination Coverage (4.5%), reflecting strong vaccination efforts.
  - South America has the highest Case Detection Rate (60.08%), a high CFR (2.8%), and moderate Vaccination Coverage (1.33%), indicating challenges with both high death rates and vaccination coverage.
