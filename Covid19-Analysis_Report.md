## 5. Deadliest Month (Highest Monthly Deaths)
### Findings:
- **January 2021 saw the highest number of COVID-19 deaths**.
- **December 2020 & April 2021** were also critical months with high fatalities.
- **Early pandemic months (Janâ€“Mar 2020) had fewer deaths** due to limited global spread.
- **Vaccination efforts in early 2021 helped reduce mortality**, but deaths remained high before widespread immunity.

## 6. Top 2 Countries by Percentage of Population Vaccinated
### Findings:
- **Gibraltar led globally with 97.47% of its population fully vaccinated**.
- **Seychelles followed with 60.16%**.

- **Vaccination Coverage (Higher indicates better prevention)**

### Findings:
- **Oceania managed the pandemic best**, with **low cases and mortality**.
- **South America struggled the most**, with **high mortality and case rates**.
- **Asia & Europe** implemented **effective control measures** and had **strong healthcare support**.
