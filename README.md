# 🦠 **COVID-19 Data Analysis**

## 📌 **Overview**  
This project analyzes **COVID-19 data** using **SQL queries** on **MS SQL Server**, focusing on **global trends, mortality rates, vaccination impact, and testing effectiveness**. The data spans from **January 1, 2020, to March 30, 2021** and includes key metrics such as **cases, deaths, vaccinations, and tests**. The analysis offers insights into **pandemic progression, regional variations, and the effectiveness of interventions**.

## 📂 **Dataset Overview**  
The datasets used in this project are:
- (`Covid_Deaths.xlsx`) - Contains 85172 Rows and 26 Columns
- (`Covid_Vaccinations.xlsx`) - Contains 85172 Rows and 37 Columns

These datasets were imported into **MS SQL** for analysis, and **complex SQL queries** were used to extract meaningful insights from the data.

## 📊 **What the Report Includes**  
The `Covid19-Analysis_Report.md` contains:
- **Global Trends in Cases, Deaths, and Vaccinations**
- **Mortality Analysis & CFR (Case Fatality Rate) Trends**
- **Impact of Vaccinations on Cases & Deaths**
- **Testing Rates vs. Case Detection**
- **Continental Comparison of COVID-19 Metrics**

## 📜 **What's Included?**  
📂 **SQL Queries (`SQL_Queries.md`)** – All SQL scripts used for data retrieval and analysis.  
📓 **SQL Notebook (`COVID_Queries_Notebook.ipynb`)** – SQL notebook with executed queries and results.  
📄 **Full Business Report (`Covid19-Analysis_Report.md`)** – A report of the findings.  
📊 **Datasets** – (`Covid_Deaths.xlsx`) and (`Covid_Vaccinations.xlsx`) - Raw data files used for analysis.  

## 🛠 **Tools Used**  
- **MS SQL Server** – Data querying & analysis.  
- **Azure Data Studio** – SQL notebook creation & execution.  
- **GitHub** – Version control & documentation.
