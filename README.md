# 🦠 **COVID-19 Data Analysis**

## 📌 **Overview**  
This project analyzes **COVID-19 data** using **SQL queries** on **MS SQL Server**. This report analyzes global COVID-19 trends from **January 1, 2020** to **April 30, 2021**, using key metrics such as cases, deaths, vaccinations, mortality rates, and test positivity rates. 

The data highlights critical phases of the pandemic, including the late 2020 surge, the impact of early 2021 vaccinations, and variations in pandemic management across continents. The findings provide insights into how different regions handled the crisis and the role of vaccinations in reducing fatalities.

## 📂 **Dataset Overview**  
The datasets used in this project are:
- (`Covid_Deaths.xlsx`) - Contains 85172 Rows and 26 Columns
- (`Covid_Vaccinations.xlsx`) - Contains 85172 Rows and 37 Columns

These datasets were imported into **MS SQL** for analysis, and **SQL queries** were used to extract meaningful insights from the data.

## 📊 **What the Report Includes**  
The `Covid19-Analysis_Report.md` contains:
- **Global COVID-19 Trends Over Time**
- **Countries with Highest Cases, Deaths, and Vaccinations**
- **Countries with the Highest Mortality Rate**
- **Country with the Highest Daily Spike in Cases**
- **Deadliest Month (Highest Monthly Deaths)**
- **Countries by Percentage of Population Vaccinated**
- **Which Continents Handled the Pandemic Best?**
